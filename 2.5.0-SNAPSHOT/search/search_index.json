Setup and Build Documentation # We use mkdocs together with mike ( for versioning ) to build the documentation and a plugin called keras-autodoc to auto generate Python API documentation from docstrings. Background about mike : mike builds the documentation and commits it as a new directory to the gh-pages branch. Each directory corresponds to one version of the documentation. Additionally, mike maintains a json in the root of gh-pages with the mappings of versions/aliases for each of the directories available. With aliases you can define extra names like dev or latest , to indicate stable and unstable releases. Currently we are using our own version of keras-autodoc pip install git+https://github.com/logicalclocks/keras-autodoc@split-tags-properties Install HSML with docs extras: pip install -e . [ dev,docs ] To build the docs, first run the auto doc script: cd .. python auto_doc.py Option 1: Build only current version of docs # Either build the docs, or serve them dynamically: Note: Links and pictures might not resolve properly later on when checking with this build. The reason for that is that the docs are deployed with versioning on docs.hopsworks.ai and therefore another level is added to all paths, e.g. docs.hopsworks.ai/[version-or-alias] . Using relative links should not be affected by this, however, building the docs with version (Option 2) is recommended. mkdocs build # or mkdocs serve Option 2 (Preferred): Build multi-version doc with mike # Versioning on docs.hopsworks.ai # On docs.hopsworks.ai we implement the following versioning scheme: current master branches (e.g. of hsml corresponding to master of Hopsworks): rendered as current Hopsworks snapshot version, e.g. 2.2.0-SNAPSHOT [dev] , where dev is an alias to indicate that this is an unstable version. the latest release: rendered with full current version, e.g. 2.1.5 [latest] with latest alias to indicate that this is the latest stable release. previous stable releases: rendered without alias, e.g. 2.1.4 .

A model is the product of training a machine learning algorithm with training data.

In this Quickstart Guide we are going to focus on how data scientists can create models and publish them to the model registry to make them available for further development and serving. HSML library # The Hopsworks model registry library is called hsml ( H opswork s M achine L earning). The library is Apache V2 licensed and available here . The library currently comes with a Python SDK. If you want to connect to the Model Registry from outside Hopsworks, see our integration guides . The library is build around metadata-objects, representing entities within the Model Registry. You can modify metadata by changing it in the metadata-objects and subsequently persisting it to the Model Registry. In fact, the Model Registry itself is also represented by an object. Furthermore, these objects have methods to save model artifacts along with the entities in the model registry.
