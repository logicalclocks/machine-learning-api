# Model

A Model is an artifact that has been trained to recognize certain patterns. In addition to the artifact itself, a great deal of information is needed to describe it. The Model abstraction lets you save the model artifact along with metadata.

## Versioning

Models can be versioned. When a new Model is published to the Model Registry it is automatically incremented.
